**Instagram Widget Update**

One of my favorite widgets had an issue that has plague me for months. The fundamental issue is that prior to the months before, Instagram allows querying public profile data via their API anonymously without needed a developer account. Soon after, that has been rate-limited and it broke my widget.

I never found a way to actually fix it nor found the time to do more research for it.

Until yesterday. A [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scriptable/comments/llpxmv/widget_for_instagram/) by [u/jonaswiebe](https://www.reddit.com/user/jonaswiebe/) on the [r/scriptable](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scriptable) shared a widget for Instagram stats. The curious me checked it out. And I was amazed on how it worked and is was very simple at that. 

Bottomline is, I applied the same approach to my script, a few tweaks here and there and now I have an update.
